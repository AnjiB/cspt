# UI Performance Monitoring System

- This project offers set of services to store, visualise various metrics from Selenium based test project
- If want to know, how to store metrics from test project, please follow these [instructions](https://github.com/AnjiB/cspt/blob/main/ui-tests/docs/Performance.md).

## How to start services?

Execute below commands on shell.

**Note:** I implemented this setup on Mac Apple chip, we many need to alter compose file to make it run on Windows or Apple M1.
